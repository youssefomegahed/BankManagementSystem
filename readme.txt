This application enables the user to:

1) Add customers through entering their personal data. The customers are saved in a linked list that can be accessed at any time while using the application. The interface allows for the user to enter multiple customers with ease.

2) Search for customers using their ID or their name. Searching by name can be partial, which means that even if just the first name is correct, then results will display (same applies with last name). After searching for a customer, the interface will allow the user to
- Create an account for the customer (more than one can be created for a single customer)
- Deposit/withdraw money into and from the customer's account
- Display all user's accounts (with their balance, type, etc..)
- Display the user's information (email, phone number, address, etc..)

3) Delete a customer by inserting their ID

4) Display all customers with some information about them

5) Search for an account using the account number

---

The program accounts for wrong input, such as when withdrawing too much money or when the user tries to create a customer with an ID that already exists, and outputs error messages.

Although account numbers are randomized, there is an algorithm that ensures account numbers are never repeated.
